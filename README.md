# OSeXy
A script your OSX will be glad to call its first.

**OSeXy** is a bootstrap intended to be the very first script to be ran on a fresh OSX install. It will:

1. Check for system updates
2. Install Xcode command line tools
3. Install homebrew and several [formulas](https://github.com/timgws/OSeXy/blob/master/Brewfile) & [casks](https://github.com/timgws/OSeXy/blob/master/Caskfile)
4. Set [OSX sensitive defaults](https://github.com/timgws/OSeXy/blob/master/osx.sh)
5. Download and install [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info)
6. Download IE8, IE9 and IE10 VMs from [modern.ie](https://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads)

## How to use

    sh install.sh

## Disclaimer
OSeXy is a WIP personal project, hence it's very opinionated, poorly tested and incomplete. I'll improve it over time, but maybe you can find one or two niceties on how I tackle OSX bootstrapping.

Please check the source before using it.

This repository has been forked from [Jo√£o Cunha](https://github.com/joaocunha)'s original OSeXy, mainly because we are different human beings, with different highlighting tastes, and I own VMWare/MS Office licenses!

## Support
Tested on Yosemite 10.10.1 only.
